This is a version of the game Breakout. It is written in Python and uses the PyGame module. I made this game so that I could really understand how video games work. I had prior experience with the Unity game engine, but this was more challenging because of the many low-level concepts I had to work with. Since there was no engine, only the tools for drawing images on the screen, I had to start from scratch and work my way up to a functional game.

To run this game, you can run the executable /dist/main.exe as long as you have the Microsoft Visual C runtime DLL, which is included in installs of Python or Visual Studio.

To run it directly, run main.py with a Python interpreter that includes the PyGame module.

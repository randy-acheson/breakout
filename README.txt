This is a version of the game Breakout written in Python using the PyGame module. The objective of the game is to break all of the bricks with the ball by moving the paddle left and right. It is not feature complete yet, so there are no win conditions or losing conditions. I made this game so that I could really understand how video games work. I had prior experience with the Unity game engine, but this was more challenging because of the many low-level concepts I had to work with. Since there was no engine, only the tools for drawing images on the screen, I had to start from scratch and work my way up to a functional game.

To run this game, you can run the executable /dist/main.exe as long as you have the Microsoft Visual C runtime DLL, which is included in installs of Python or Visual Studio.

To run it directly, run main.py with a Python interpreter that includes the PyGame module.
